# Free OneDrive Image Hosting

This project allows you to upload images to your own OneDrive spaces and generate sharing links, which can be used as the `src` attribute of `<img>` tags.

It is deployed in my github pages, [click this link and have a try](https://harrisoff.github.io/onedrive.html). You can fork and **Build Your Own Image Hosting Service** as well.

## Development

This is basically a webGUI of [@harrisoff/onedrive-api](https://github.com/harrisoff/onedrive-api).

Before starting local server, create `env.development` file in the root directory and fill it like `env.production`, but replace values with yours.

## TODO List
